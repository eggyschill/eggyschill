- 👋 Hello! I'm Eduardo, known as my programming alias eggyschill. My nickname comes from a childhood friend who struggled to say my name properly - ended up just calling me egg!
- 👀 I'm currently on the path of learning new languages, paradigms, and general computer science. 
- 💞️ I'm solidifying my abilities before I jump into any collaborations, but down the line I am hoping that my experience can assist others!
- 📫 How to reach me : eleopeleram@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I rock climb!
